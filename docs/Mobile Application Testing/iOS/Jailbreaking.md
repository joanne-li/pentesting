Palera1n is a jailbreak available for iOS 15.0-16.5. You need to run Palera1n from a Mac or a bootable version of Linux, and follow the instructions on screen.

> [!Note]
> You need to reset the iPhone and set it up with no passcode for iOS 16 and later, otherwise the jailbreak will not work

After the phone is jailbroken, install Sileo, which is the "app store" for jailbroken devices.

*Note that once the iphone restarts, the jailbreak is lost*
1. Download the palera1n binary on your MacBook
2. Connect the iPhone to the MacBook via USB-A to Lightning, and USB-A to USB-C dongle.
3. Create a fake file system for the device
```
palerain -cf
```
4. Hit enter when the executable says hit enter. Follow the onscreen instructions. Make sure to hold the volume down and power button at the same time. Then continue holding the volume down button.
5. Unplug the cord when the executable errors out and replug the cable.
6. Re-jailbreak the device in rootful mode with
```
palerain -f
```
7. Redo step 4

Palera1n should now appear as an app on the phone. Install the Sileo package manager
## SSH
1. Install NewTerm2 from Sileo
2. Change the root password of the iphone on NewTerm2
```
sudo passwd root
```
3. SSH to our iPhone from our computer
```
ssh root@IP of phone
```
