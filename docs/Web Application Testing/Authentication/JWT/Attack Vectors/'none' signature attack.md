The algorithm used to sign a JWT is specified in the `alg` field of its header.

A user can modify the algorithm so it is set to `none`. This will result in the signature being an empty string `signature = ''` . Most JWT library implementations will fail token verification, if `none` is specified as the algorithm and a secret key is provided by the application.

If an application does not perform token verification properly, an attacker can modify JWTs without detection. This can allow an attacker to gain access to restricted resources, impersonate other users and escalate privileges.

For example, as an attacker, we can modify our scope area to elevate our privileges. Another way we can gain additional privileges is to modify the unique identifier in the payload to an ID of another user (if the field exists).
