Note that the **HMAC** algorithm involves a **symmetric** key to verify JWT communicated back and forth between the client and server. 

**RSA** can also be specified as an algorithm, but uses asymmetric keys. The public key is known to the client while the server signs the data with their private key, and verifies it with its corresponding public key.

**The catch**
Suppose the backend system intends to verify the token via RSA. In its intended functionality,  the server verify that the signature matches the header and payload after decrypting it, using its public key.

`assert(decrypt(public key, signature) == header+payload)`

But since the user controls the algorithm specified in the header, I can change RSA256/384/512 to HS256. This will indicate to the server, to verify the token by comparing the hashes produced by HMAC using the key on the backend.

Since I know the server's public key, I can produce a signature using HMAC, using the public key. The server will then verify the token by using this public key (symmetric key).
